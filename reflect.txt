I was able to practice most of the topics learned during the term. 
Part 1 and Part 2 of the project were the easiest because some tasks were very similar to the ones I had already completed in other Workshops.

Part 3 was more challenging but mostly for me, to clearly understand the instructions. During this project, I felt more confident about how to start writing the code. Now I know how to make sense of the documentation and use the theoretical knowledge I gained during the semester to understand how to use new methods or algorithms already defined in different libraries.

It took me about 20 - 24 hours to finish the entire project.

Thank you, professor, because, before this semester, I knew how to write basic cpp code but now, thanks to your lectures, I know the reason why I do it, why we use references or pointers when it is best to use certain functions, etc.
The effort you took to prepare for every class is greatly appreciated. It always felt like a top-level computer science class, which, sadly, is rare to find.
